(a) The equivalent to the Product owner in a non-Agile project would be the Development Lead or a Team Lead of some kind. The role of the Product Owner in Agile methodology is to facilitate issues and delegate them to other members of the team.
(b) While the Product Owner more so creates a path for the team to take and guide them to that path, the Scrum Master is the more hands counterpart to that role. The Scrum Master activiely creates issues in the Scrum framework and regularly holds meetings to solve them.
(c) The three meeting types are sprint planning, daily standup, and sprint review. Sprint planning is a meeting to choose what issues will go in a particular sprint. The daily standup is a frequent, short meeting type to decide what will be done by who in a shorter time frame in a sprint, in other words, the specifics of how the sprint will function. The sprint review is at the end or close to the end of a sprint, and reviews the progress made in the sprint and makes sure there are no issues before the sprint is released.
